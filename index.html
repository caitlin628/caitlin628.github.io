                                pursue an artistic career. I graduated summa cum laude from

                                In my senior year, I was in the

                                chamber orchestra, and a quartet! I'm very fortunate to be able to continue playing
                                violin at
                                Miami in MUSO! I also enjoy knitting, hiking, and watching movies.</p>

                <p style="font-size:larger"> I had the opportunity to shadow a UI/UX designer from STERIS at the end of
                    my senior year. While
                    sitting
                    in on a
                    cross-disciplinary project meeting, I discovered just how much designers and software developers
                    must
                    collaborate. Supplementing my Communication Design major with an applied concentration in ETBD will
                    undoubtedly prepare me for
                    that kind of
                    professional environment in the future.</p>

                <p style="font-size:larger">When it comes to art, I have always considered myself a "jack of all
                    trades, master of none." I
                    can
                    draw,
                    paint,
                    printmake, knit, embroider&hellip; you name it! While I used to see this as a weakness, I now
                    see my
                    wide range of
                    interests and talents as my greatest asset. The ETBD program will give me a wealth of new
                    skills
                    to add
                    to my toolbox, enhancing my existing abilities and making me a more capable designer. </p>

        <tr>

                <h3 class="larger">Complementary classes</h3>
                <p style="font-size:larger">
                    The classes offered in the ETBD program will perfectly complement my Communication Design curriculum
                    so
                    that I can graduate with a multidisciplinary understanding of design in the modern industry. Whereas
                    Comm Design will give me a strong studio background, ETBD will prepare me for an increasingly
                    digital professional landscape. I am still unsure exactly what career path I want to take after
                    college, but I know ETBD classes geared toward User Experience Research and Digital Art Tools will
                    equip me to succeed in an array of jobs. Technology is becoming integrated into every facet of our
                    lives, and I know it is advantageous for me to learn as much about it as I can.
                </p>
                <h3 class= "larger" style="margin-top: 40px">Internship and professional skills</h3>
                <p style="font-size:larger">Participating in an internship during my time at Miami is one of my top
                    priorities, so I was
                    thrilled to discover that there is a required internship for ETBD students. Because internships are
                    woven into
                    the curriculum, I know that I'll get the support and resources I need to connect me with valuable
                    pre-professional
                    opportunities. Gaining practical experience as an intern will be crucical in developing my skills
                    and
                    preparing me to be a working designer.
                </p>
                <h3 class="larger" style="margin-top: 40px">Maximizing my time at Miami</h3>
                <p style="font-size:larger">I am mainly interested in ETBD because I believe this program will allow me
                    to get the most out of my
                    time at Miami. I am aware that adding an applied concentration in ETBD to my Comm Design major will
                    greatly increase my course load, but I am up for the challenge! I want to create, learn, and accomplish as
                    much as possible over the next 4 years, and I want ETBD to be part of my experience!
